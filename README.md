# Global Happiness Trends: 2015-2022

## INTRODUCTION
Happiness is an essential measure of well-being, and analyzing global happiness trends can provide valuable insights into the factors influencing life satisfaction across different countries. This project explores the World Happiness Report (WHR) data from 2015 to 2022, focusing on key metrics such as Happiness Rank, Happiness Score, Country, and Year.  
We aim to uncover trends in happiness over time, identify countries that have improved or declined significantly, and visualize major shifts in global rankings. Through line charts, bar charts, and heatmaps, we will analyze how happiness scores have changed and which nations have experienced the most notable movements.  
By conducting this analysis, we hope to better understand the global patterns of happiness and the socio-economic factors that may contribute to these changes.

## DATA STRUCTURE
The dataset used in this project comes from the World Happiness Report (WHR), which ranks countries based on survey data related to subjective well-being. It spans from 2015 to 2022, allowing us to analyze trends in happiness over the years.

### Key Columns in the Dataset:
- **Country** – The name of the country surveyed.
- **Year** – The year of the survey (2015–2022).
- **Happiness Rank** – The ranking of the country based on happiness scores.
- **Happiness Score** – A numerical value representing overall happiness, typically ranging from 0 to 10.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This project analyzes global happiness trends over the period from 2015 to 2022 using data from the World Happiness Report. The focus is on Happiness Score, Happiness Rank, and Country, with a particular emphasis on changes in happiness rankings and scores over the years.

### Key Insights:

#### Heatmap (Ranking Changes Over Time 2015-2022):
- The top 10 happiest countries experienced relative stability in their rankings from 2015 to 2018, with only minor fluctuations observed.
- However, in 2020 and 2021, all countries show a ranking of 78, likely indicating missing or unreliable data during the pandemic period, which disrupted global data reporting.
- By 2022, Finland reclaimed the 1st position, while countries such as Denmark and Iceland maintained their presence in the top three.

#### Line Chart (Happiness Score Trend 2015-2022):
- From 2015 to 2019, most countries exhibited a stable or slightly increasing trend in happiness scores.
- A sharp drop in 2020 is evident across all nations, likely linked to the global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Scores rebounded in 2021, showing a recovery in global happiness, before experiencing a slight decline in 2022.

#### Bar Chart (Comparison of Happiness Scores 2015 vs. 2022):
- Happiness scores were generally higher in 2015 compared to 2022 across the top 10 countries.
- The decrease in scores in 2022 could be attributed to several global factors such as economic instability, societal changes, and the post-pandemic effects on national well-being.
- Despite the decline, the same countries remained in the top 10 rankings, demonstrating a consistent trend in overall happiness at the highest levels.

### Conclusion:
This analysis reveals that while global happiness rankings remained relatively stable, the impact of major global events, notably the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly influenced happiness scores in 2020. The trends observed highlight the resilience of the top-ranked countries, as they continue to hold their positions despite global challenges. The insights provided here can guide policymakers, researchers, and organizations in understanding the factors that shape global happiness and well-being over time.
